## description
Minimalist example of passwordless two factor authentication using Node.js Plivo socket.io and Firebase
custom authentication

then multiple http calls are required to server and the server needs to ensure that
user is properly authenticated so no one will tamper the data.
As an alternative we can use one socket connection for all steps.
